# Real time emotion recognition

I'm using a pre-trained model with an accuracy of **68.7%** over FER 2013 dataset. Thanks to @elfadly for providing with the pre trained model.
If you wish to train your own model download FER2013 from Kaggle

For more insight on the opencv part check out my previous repo- meme_generator
Will be adding better face detection classifiers soon
